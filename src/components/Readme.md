# Components
Here you can create all the common components of the project that you need.

## Structure
You must have the following structure:

```
    /components
        /component-name
            index.js
            _component-name.scss
            reducer.js
            action.js
            /tests
            	spec-name.specs.js
```

The child components follow the same structure.
